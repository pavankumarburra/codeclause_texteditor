# codeclause_texteditor
A notepad is a text-only editor that only works with .txt files but can still read and edit file formats that can be edited. This project is a very simple one to make, but you are still going to have a lot of fun creating it.
The objective of this is to create a GUI-based Text Editor in Python. To build this, you will need a basic understanding of Tkinter library but some knowledge of rarer and intermediate widgets like the Text widget and the Scrollbar widget is also required.
To build this text editor in python, we will need the following libraries:

1. Tkinter – To create the GUI.
2. PIL (Python Image Library) – To give the GUI window an icon.
3. OS – To get the path of the file.
